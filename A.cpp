/*
You are walking down the escalator to catch a subway train. The escalator itself
moves at a speed of Ve meters per minute. You can walk down the escalator at a
relative speed of Vy meters per minute. The length of the escalator is L meters.
Trains arrive T minutes apart. Let t be the time between your arrival to the station
if you stand still on the escalator and the arrival of the last train before your arrival.
Assume that t is a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and T. Return the
probability of catching an earlier train if you choose to walk down the escalator instead
of standing still on it.

Input :

The first line of the input contains an integer Tc denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains the following 4 lines

Ve - velocity of escalator

Vy - your relative velocity with the escalator

L - length of escalator

T - Time Period of Train(s)

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the expected probability having an
absolute or relative error less than 10^-6.
